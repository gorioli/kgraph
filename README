How to use graph:
-----------------
1. ZOOM IN: 
	- x axis by clicking on the graph and draging the mouse to the side.
	- y axis by pressing 'a' key and mouse draging 
2. ZOOM OUT:
	- double click on the mouse in the graph area

-----------------------------------------
The server's URL has to be in the query string under the 'feed' key in order to fetch data every 'N' mSec.
The latency interval 'N' is configured in the graph.js file under updateInterval variable.

-----------------------------------------

The graph uses 'GET' method to connect with the server, it sends just one parameter now:
- 'frame' is the last frame number, which was read from the server feed

-----------------------------------------

Examples of URLs for rendering the graph:

1. LINES - load lines json file:
knushka.com/kgraph/?feed=data/lines/multi_kv_1.json 

2. BAR GRAPHS - load bars json file:
knushka.com/kgraph/?feed=data/bars/barfeed-2.json
knushka.com/kgraph/?feed=data/bars/barfeed-1.json
knushka.com/kgraph/?feed=data/bars/barfeed-4.json
knushka.com/kgraph/?feed=data/bars/bpch-old.json

3. load any type graph with random update from a hard drive:
knushka.com/kgraph/?random=true

4. load Lines with random:
knushka.com/kgraph/?feed=data/lines/multi_kv_1_old.json&random=true

-----------------------------------------
The programm supports 2 data types for reading from local file, 
which are used for line or bar graph. 
In addition, it supports 3 types of json formats for updates, 
1 for line graph (with mode 'kv_1') and 2 for bars (with mode 'vector_2' and 'bpch').
Examples of these data formats are available under "sampledata"
